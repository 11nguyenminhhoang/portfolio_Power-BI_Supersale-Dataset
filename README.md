# portfolio_PowerBI_Supersale_NguyenMinhHoang
I was use a sample data called SuperSale Store - a sales company, and faced issues around business cases: sales / profit and Return of investment...
Based on that situation, I built Dashboards with Power BI as follows:

1. Sale: observe the amount of revenue coming from segments, categories of goods, list of key customers ....
2. Quantity : observe the amount of goods sold to have a reasonable warehousing policy and solve the problem of late shipping that still exists
3. Analyze profit margin to determine discount policy and optimize costs, as well as observe the focus strategy for key segments / products

The process I used to generate this report is as follows:
1. Use Power Query to merge and process excel files into a single file, complying with Schema as shown. Easy to update if new data is available.
2. Process Power Query to handling cleaning data types, handling date format and creating calculation parameters such as ROI, late/early/on-time delivery...
3. Use Dax and some operations to display data on Power BI.


#Note I have 2 PDF and PBIX files for the reader's convenience.
Sincerely.
