# portfolio_PowerBI_Supersale_NguyenMinhHoang
I was use a sample data called SuperSale Store - a sales company, and faced issues around business cases: sales / profit and Return of investment...
Based on that situation, I built Dashboards with Power BI as follows:

1. Sale: observe the amount of revenue coming from segments, categories of goods, list of key customers ....
2. Quantity : observe the amount of goods sold to have a reasonable warehousing policy and solve the problem of late shipping that still exists
3. Analyze profit margin to determine discount policy and optimize costs, as well as observe the focus strategy for key segments / products
